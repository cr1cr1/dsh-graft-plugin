/**
 * Keep the graft graph current as the model edits code.
 *
 * WHAT CLAUDE CODE GETS THAT dsh DOES NOT
 *
 * `graft init` installs two hooks there: a post-edit hook that marks the graph
 * dirty, and a Stop hook that rebuilds it at the end of a turn. dsh is not one
 * of the agents `graft init` knows (`--list-agents`: agents, adal, cursor,
 * gemini, grok, hermes, antigravity, copilot, kiro, windsurf, claude), so a dsh
 * user is left running `graft build` by hand and, in practice, forgetting to.
 *
 * This is the same two hooks on dsh's own seams — `tools/execute` for the edit
 * signal, `agent/turn-stopping` for the rebuild — plus a third trigger graft
 * does not need: a debounced rebuild DURING a turn. Claude Code turns are short;
 * one turn here can run half an hour across dozens of edits, and waiting for its
 * end would leave the model querying a graph it had already invalidated.
 *
 * IT REUSES GRAFT'S OWN SCRIPT, NOT A REIMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * The rebuild is graft's `dist/claude/sync-run.js`, spawned exactly as its Stop
 * hook spawns it, and the dirty/lock bookkeeping goes through graft's own
 * `state.js`. That matters for three reasons: `sync-run` already patches
 * `stats.json` on the way out (clearing `dirty`, stamping `syncedAt`, writing
 * the new counts), which is the file the status chip reads — so the chip shows
 * "syncing" then "in sync" for free; the lock is graft's, so a dsh rebuild and
 * a Claude Code rebuild in the same repo cannot run over each other; and its
 * money guard travels with it.
 *
 * THE MONEY GUARD
 *
 * `sync-run.js` carries the comment "MONEY GUARD: plain `graft build` only —
 * structural, $0, offline. Never --deep." Calling that script rather than
 * assembling an argv here is what keeps that promise true: an automatic
 * rebuild can never start billing an LLM, because the code that decides the
 * arguments is graft's, not this plugin's.

/**
 * Tools whose success means the working tree may have moved.
 *
 * THESE ARE dsh's REAL WIRE NAMES. The list previously read `write_file`,
 * `terminal` and `shell` — none of which dsh registers — while omitting `write`
 * and `str_replace_editor`, which it does. The effect was worst in exactly the
 * case it should have handled best: in a NEW repo every file arrives through
 * `write`, so nothing was ever marked dirty and the graph stayed at whatever
 * `/graft` first built until someone ran `graft build` by hand. `edit` and the
 * shells worked, which is why it looked intermittent rather than broken.
 *
 * Source of truth, from the packages that register them:
 *   dsh-tool-fs                  write · edit   (also read, read_image)
 *   dsh-tool-str-replace-editor  str_replace_editor
 *   dsh-tool-bash / -pwsh        bash · pwsh
 *
 * The shells are on the list deliberately. graft's own post-edit hook watches
 * file-editing tools, but in this deployment most files arrive from a script
 * the model runs — a Blender export, a Godot build — and an edit-tools-only
 * trigger would miss exactly the changes that matter most. The cost of being
 * broad is bounded by the design: the flag only marks the graph dirty, and the
 * debounce collapses a burst of writes into a single rebuild.
 *
 * Override with the row's `autoBuildTools` if a deployment registers others.
