/**
 * graft-status — show which graft graph this dsh is actually serving.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The `mcp-graft` row in the web profile spawns `graft mcp` once per dsh boot,
 * with no directory argument, so graft resolves "nearest ancestor with a graft/
 * index" from dsh's working directory. That is invisible from the UI: the
 * composer shows the model and the workspace, but nothing says which repo's
 * graph the graft tools answer from — or whether that graph still matches the
 * code.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is not a small confusion. An earlier version of the MCP
 * row pinned graft to ~/.dsh; a session opened on another project silently got
 * answers about the harness instead, and the only symptom was a freshness
 * check reporting a node count that belonged to a different repo.
 *
 * WHICH DIRECTORY IT RESOLVES FROM
 *
 * The SESSION's cwd (`session.header.cwd`), falling back to `process.cwd()`
 * only when a session has none.
 *
 * An earlier version used `process.cwd()` alone, reasoning that it matched what
 * `graft mcp` resolves and so could never disagree with the tools. In practice
 * that made it agree with the tools about the wrong repo: dsh launched from a
 * home directory while the session's workspace was a project elsewhere, and the
 * chip reported "no graft index above C:\\Users\\adith" for a workspace that has
 * a perfectly good index. Matching a stale answer is not consistency.
 *
 * The MCP server cannot follow suit — one stdio child is spawned per dsh boot,
 * so its root is fixed at launch. When the two disagree, this one is right
 * about the workspace and the MCP tools are answering about wherever dsh was
 * started. Launching dsh from the repo makes both agree.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *
 * Pure reads of files graft already writes. It never runs `graft`, never
 * writes to the index, and never makes a network request — so it cannot make
 * a graph stale, and it costs nothing when graft is absent.

 * The standing instruction to prefer graft over grep/read.

 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE DEPLOYMENT PERSONA

 *
 *   # The preset's own persona, shadowing the deployment default for this agent.
 *   - id: persona
 *     name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-persona'
 *     config: { text: 'You are a coding agent powered by {{model}} …' }

 * Both sides name the same section, `deployment:persona`, and that is exactly
 * what makes the preset REPLACE it rather than add to it. Anything written into
 * the deployment persona is silently dropped for every session that joins a
 * preset — which, on this surface, is all of them.
 *
 * A section of this plugin's own has no such conflict: it is registered on the
 * agent's own context under its own name, so it survives whichever preset the
 * session happens to use, and it travels with the tools it describes instead of
 * living in a config file that has to remember they exist.
 *
 * WHY IT READS AS A PREFERENCE
 *
 * A hard "always use graft" is how the old graft-context skill caused a real
 * failure: it said to run `graft check` first, the model obeyed past the point
 * of sense, read "NO GRAPH" from the one tool that needs a deep build, and gave
 * up without trying the five that worked.
